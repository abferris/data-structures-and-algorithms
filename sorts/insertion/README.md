## Challenge
Create a funciton that executes a insertion-sort

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach very closely followed what was given to us by the explanation referenced below.  
The efficiency of space is O(1) and time is O(n^2)

## Tests and completion
This function should have:  
[X] A randomly generated unsorted array returns the array sorted
[X] A sorted array returns the same sorted array
[X] A backwards-sorted array returns the array sorted
[X] An empty array returns the same empty array
[X] An array of one element returns the same single-element array
