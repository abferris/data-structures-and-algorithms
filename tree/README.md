## Challenge 1

* Create A Binary Tree Class
  * function preOrder
  * function inOrder
  * function postOrder
* Create A Binary Search Tree
  * has add value and puts a value in the place of a binary search tree
  * has contains, which returns boolean if they do or don't contain the value

## Approach 
* NOTE: I have issues with the traversals
* Below are the whiteboards planning how to do this.
