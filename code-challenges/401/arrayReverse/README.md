# Array Reverse Code challenge

Code Challenge - 01
March 18, 2019
## Challenge
The challenge is to reverse an array without using built in methods.

## Approach and Efficiency
We ran through the array with a for loop, starting at array.length-1 and ending at 0, pushing to a new array each time.

I belive that the efficiency should be O(n), but we haven't gone through it
