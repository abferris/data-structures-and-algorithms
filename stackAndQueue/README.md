# DSA Stacks and Queues
DSA 2: Stacks and Queues

## Challenge 1
Completed with Jon Gentry. Recieved assistance explination from Benicio (a night teacher which I do not know his last name).

* Create a stack
  * Should optionally take input and have a top
  * Create the push method 
    * Should take input and a node with input as value  it on the top of the stack
  * Create the pop method
    * Should take no input, take node off the top, and return it's value
  * Create Peek method
    * Returns the value of the top
* Create a queue
  * Should optionally take input and have a front and rear
  * Create the enqueue method 
    * Should take input and a node with input as value  it at the rear of the queue
  * Create the dequeue method
    * Should take no input, take node off the front, and return it's value
  * Create Peek method
    * Returns the value of the front

## Approach 
* Below are the whiteboards planning how to do this.
  * Note: clouds are the class. Arrows are properties, and boxes are nodes. If an arrow is unlabeled, it is a next property. Each step shows exactly what is happening.
* Stacks
