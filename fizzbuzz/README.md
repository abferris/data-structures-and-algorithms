* Fizzbuzz Function
  * it will run on a binary tree
  * it will replace all instances of a number divisible by 3 with fizz
  * it will replace all instances of a number divisible by 5 with buzz
  * it will replace all instances of a number divisible by 3 and 5 with fizzbuzz


## Approach 
* Use a similar method as traversals
  * Recursively goes through each method
  * first check and evaluate whether the number should be modified
  * then recursively call it on the left child
  * then recursively call it on the right child

### Tests
#### Challenge 1  
##### Binary Tree and BST
[x] It will fizz  
[x] It will buzz    
[x] It will fizzbuzz 
[x] it will work on an empty tree
